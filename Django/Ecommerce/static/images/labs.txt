- create static directory in your project and add it to settings.py using STATIC_ROOT, STATICFILES and collectstatic (in terminal)
- Create a base.html template which has the design of your website (navbar, footer or any shared designs to be included within the whole website)

Note:
- There was an include step that I don't remember, please add it if you do.

- Create the required pages (index.html, mart.html, cart.html) and extend from the base.html using the jinja or DTL syntax
- Create a dictionary with list of products, or excel file or any source that has list of products
- Create the required views for mart and cart
- A form must be created in the mart.html in which you loop on the products returned from the excel file to show them and submit the chosen products be the user
- The mart function must POST the form in query parameteres and return redirect to the cart page
- The cart function should GET the return the parameters (products) to be shown the cart.html page

Finally:

Create a repo with name Django, make it public or private and send an invitation to Eg. Menna,
create a branch for each day or with the app name and before merging to main, make a pull request to be confirmed by her,
and when she approves, merge to the main

Feel free to add all the css styles or js logic you need.
